The default website already has minification and gzip compression enabled. For a
typical page you should be able to save more than 50% in resource size, which
means without you doing anything your website's performance is doubled.

If you want to disable minification for css or js or html, browse to your site
edit page and uncheck the 'Minify HTML' or 'Minify Javascript' or 'Minify CSS'
checkboxes.
