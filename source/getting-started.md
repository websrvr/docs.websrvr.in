##1. Signup on websrvr
You can signup for websrv by clicking on the *Start your free trial..* button on http://www.websrvr.in/
This will ask you to give websrvr access to **a new folder 'websrvr' created in Dropbox > Apps** (this does
not give websrvr access to your other files/folders in Dropbox).


##2. Edit the awesomexx site
As soon as you signup, we create a demo site in your Dropbox, you can view it at
*awesomexx.websrvr.in* where **xxx** is an number which should be visible in
your websrvr home page.


##3. Create new websites
If you want to create more websites, you can just create folders in your **Dropbox > Apps > websrvr** folder and they'll be online at http://*foldername*.websrvr.in

##4. Wireup a domain
Once the site is ready you can optionally put it on a **CNAME**. e.g. if you
own the domain *foobar.com* and want to put the website
*testawesome.websrvr.in* on **www.foobar.com**. All you need to do is create a
CNAME called *www* and point it to *testawesome.websrvr.in*.
`CNAME www.foobar.com => testawesome.websrvr.in`

That's all, now you have a high performance website [whose css, javascript and
html are minified and gzipped](http://blog.websrvr.in/2014/09/23/websrvr-now-minifies-and-gzips-your-css-javascript-and-html/) to give your users a fast website.
